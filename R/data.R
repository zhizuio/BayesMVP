#' Simulated data set1 for a quick test. The data set is a list with 8
#' components: binary responses \code{"Y"}, latent responses \code{"Z"},
#' covariates \code{"X"} and their effects \code{"B"}, mandatory covariates
#' \code{"X0"} and their effects \code{"B0"}, latent indicator cocariates
#' \code{"Gamma"} and response graph \code{"G"}. The R code for generating the
#' simulated data is in file \code{"data-raw\simData.R"} that designed 
#' structured relationship between response variables and covariates and 
#' structured relationship residuals.
